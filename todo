I'm going to try using either realm or another ORM DB for storage on the users device
For offline storage I have a mysql DB at home and a LAMP stack that holds data right now.
Although I would like to instead use a cloud implementation and store data there.
With android studio's new cloud features we can build our own Endpoints and deploy them with the app
